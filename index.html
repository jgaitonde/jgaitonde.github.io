I am a rising third-year PhD student in the <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at Cornell University, where I am very fortunate to be advised by <A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~eva/"   target="_blank">&Eacuteva Tardos</A>. Before that, I graduated from Yale University with degrees in <A HREF = "https://math.yale.edu/" >Mathematics </A>(B.S., with distinction) and <A HREF = "https://economics.yale.edu/"> Economics </A>(B.A.).

<p class="text-justify">
        I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, with a particular emphasis on the intersection of economics and computer science, namely in algorithm design, game theory, learning theory, and networks. Much of my research seeks to further and fortify our quantitative understanding of the emergent properties of strategic, multi-agent systems, primarily through the lens of theoretical computer science. I also maintain active interests in spectral graph theory, analysis of Boolean functions, and probability theory.

  <LI><b>Stability and Learning in Strategic Queuing Systems,</b> <i>with &Eacuteva Tardos. <br> The Twenty-First ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC 20)</i>.<br>[<a onclick='$("#abstract_div_gt20").toggle()'><font color = "#0000ff">Abstract</font></a>]&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[<a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07009.pdf' target='_blank'>PDF</a>]&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDBARYfc4-o' target='_blank'>EC Talk</a>]<br><div id='abstract_div_gt20' style='display:none'><hr>Bounding the price of anarchy, which quantifies the damage to social welfare due to selfish behavior of the participants, has been an important area of research. In this paper, we study this phenomenon in the context of a game modeling queuing systems: routers compete for servers, where packets that do not get service will be resent at future rounds, resulting in a system where the number of packets at each round depends on the success of the routers in the previous rounds. We model this as an (infinitely) repeated game, where the system holds a state (number of packets held by each queue) that arises from the results of the previous round. We assume that routers satisfy the no-regret condition, e.g. they use learning strategies to identify the server where their packets get the best service.
Classical work on repeated games makes the strong assumption that the subsequent rounds of the repeated games are independent (beyond the influence on learning from past history). The carryover effect caused by packets remaining in this system makes learning in our context result in a highly dependent random process. We analyze this random process and find that if the capacity of the servers is high enough to allow a centralized and knowledgeable scheduler to get all packets served even with double the packet arrival rate, and queues use no-regret learning algorithms, then the expected number of packets in the queues will remain bounded throughout time, assuming older packets have priority. This paper is the first to study the effect of selfish learning in a queuing system, where the learners compete for resources, but rounds are not all independent: the number of packets to be routed at each round depends on the success of the routers in the previous rounds.<hr></div></LI>

<LI><b>Adversarial Perturbations of Opinion Dynamics in Networks,</b> <i>with Jon Kleinberg and &Eacuteva Tardos. <br> The Twenty-First ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC 20)</i>.<br>[<a onclick='$("#abstract_div_gkt20").toggle()'><font color = "#0000ff">Abstract</font></a>]&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[<a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07010.pdf' target='_blank'>PDF</a>]&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoLBfqQB3wE' target='_blank'>EC Talk</a>]<br><div id='abstract_div_gkt20' style='display:none'><hr>We study the connections between network structure, opinion dynamics, and an adversary's power to artificially induce disagreements. We approach these questions by extending models of opinion formation in the social sciences to represent scenarios, familiar from recent events, in which external actors seek to destabilize communities through sophisticated information warfare tactics via fake news and bots. In many instances, the intrinsic goals of these efforts are not necessarily to shift the overall sentiment of the network, but rather to induce discord. These perturbations diffuse via opinion dynamics on the underlying network, through mechanisms that have been analyzed and abstracted through work in computer science and the social sciences. We investigate the properties of such attacks, considering optimal strategies both for the adversary seeking to create disagreement and for the entities tasked with defending the network from attack. We show that for different formulations of these types of objectives, different regimes of the spectral structure of the network will limit the adversary's capacity to sow discord; this enables us to qualitatively describe which networks are most vulnerable against these perturbations. We then consider the algorithmic task of a network defender to mitigate these sorts of adversarial attacks by insulating nodes heterogeneously; we show that, by considering the geometry of this problem, this optimization task can be efficiently solved via convex programming. Finally, we generalize these results to allow for two network structures, where the opinion dynamics process and the measurement of disagreement become uncoupled, and determine how the adversary's power changes; for instance, this may arise when opinion dynamics are controlled an online community via social media, while disagreement is measured along "real-world" connections.<hr></div></LI>

<LI><b>Fractional Pseudorandom Generators from Any Fourier Level,</b> <i>with Eshan Chattopadhyay, Chin Ho Lee, Shachar Lovett, and Abhishek Shetty. <br> Manuscript, 2020</i>.<br>[<a onclick='$("#abstract_div_cglls20").toggle()'><font color = "#0000ff">Abstract</font></a>]&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[<a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.01316' target='_blank'>PDF</a>]<br><div id='abstract_div_cglls20' style='display:none'><hr>We prove new results on the polarizing random walk framework introduced in recent works of Chattopadhyay et al. [CHHL18, CHLT19] that exploit $L_1$ Fourier tail bounds for classes of Boolean functions to construct pseudorandom generators (PRGs).  We show that given a bound on the $k$-th level of the Fourier spectrum, one can construct a PRG with a seed length whose quality scales with $k$.  This interpolates previous works, which either require Fourier bounds on all levels [CHHL18], or has polynomial dependence on the error parameter in the seed length [CHLT19], and thus answers an open question in [CHLT19].  As an example, we show that for polynomial error, Fourier bounds on the first $O(\log n)$ levels is sufficient to recover the seed length in [CHHL], which requires bounds on the entire tail.

We obtain our results by an alternate analysis of fractional PRGs using Taylor's theorem and bounding the degree-$k$ Lagrange remainder term using multilinearity and random restrictions.  Interestingly, our analysis relies only on the <i>level-k unsigned Fourier sum</i>, which is  potentially a much smaller quantity than the $L_1$ notion in previous works.  By generalizing a connection established in [CHHLZ20], we give a new reduction from constructing PRGs to proving correlation bounds.

Finally, using these improvements we show how to obtain a PRG for $\mathbb{F}_2$ polynomials with seed length close to the state-of-the-art construction due to Viola [Vio08], which was not known to be possible using this framework.<hr></div></LI>
